# Playground Monorepo

This is a monorepo containing multiple independent projects. Each subdirectory represents a separate project with its own purpose, dependencies, and configuration.

## Structure

- Each folder in the root is an independent project
- Projects may use different languages, frameworks, and tools
- Check each project's README or documentation for specific setup instructions

## Working with Projects

When working in this repository:
1. Navigate to the specific project folder
2. Follow that project's individual setup and development guidelines
3. Each project manages its own dependencies independently
